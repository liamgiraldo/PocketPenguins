# Pocket Penguins

## What is it?

- Pocket Penguins is a web chat app infusing elements of club penguin and discord into one.

## What do we take from each site?

### Discord

- Chat logs. If we used the chat system that club penguin had, it would be very hard to have long term conversations.

- No chat filter. Lets face it most people using this site are going to be adults.

- Pinning messages. They will appear at the top of the chat log.

- Longer messages. Club penguin limits the amount of text you can put into a message. This is for safety reasons, but we can remove it.

### Club Penguin

- Worldbuilding! Club penguin's worldbuilding is what inspired me to make this!

- Web design. I love the old web aesthetic and I wanted to try to integrate it into the site. In research, Club penguin websites from 2004 - 2005 act well as references.

- Penguins! They're awesome.

### Mixing Pot

- User profiles will be penguin cards. Like club penguin. User cards will have

  - A customized penguin *avatar*
  - Friend code (Only visible to user)
  - Buttons!
    - Request DM Button
    - Friend Request Button (Others only)
    - Mail button
    - Clothes dropdown
    - A close button
  - Pronouns
  - An emoji or pin of choice

- DM's will be *Igloos*! Some features of igloos

  - Private chatting and chat logs
  - Invite only or public options
  - Ability to decorate the space with items

- Club penguin used *servers* that hosted many people at once. Like discord, we want users to be able to make their own servers. Features of servers

  - Ability to customize and add "rooms" which act as discord channels
  - Ability to add moderators to a server. Visually, moderators will have a moderator pin that is limited their respected server.
  - The ability to ping people. Audially, pings will be done through the stock "fart noise" from club penguin.
  - Server will have adjustable setting for mods.
  - There will be one or two "Master Servers" if people wish to have a more traditional club penguin experience.
  - Newspapers for announcements for servers. Like club penguin, the news paper will be used to distribute announcements to players. Each newspaper will be specific to the server.

## Plan

- We start with the basics. Visuals are important to think about but its best to get things working. Despite this, we really do need a ground to work with. Here's a general plan.
  - 1. Work on the main page site. Styling and everything. This will set the ground work and hopefully gain some interest in whats going on. Besides, it's the only thing I know how to do.
  - 2. Make the webapp. Start with the functionallity. Assets can come after. Set a groundwork for what we want to achieve and then build off of it. This document will outline what needs to be accomplished in terms of features.
  - 3. Visuals. Some will have to be ripped from club penguin sources. Legally im not sure if this is ok. I want to try and have most things be home grown, with us drawing our own assets and using club penguin as a *heavy reference* but we will see what happens. I don't know anything about art but I hope I get some people to help me out in the future.
  - 4. Testing. We want to start figuring out social media and getting people interested in testing here. Testing our app to make sure there aren't any exploits or issues is critically important to its success.

## Site

- The site will have the following pages
  - A main page
  - The app's page
  - News page
  - Support page
  - Privacy & Safety page

### Safety Page Content

- Club penguin always prioritized safety when it came to its users. It's understandable, given that a majority of it's userbase consisted of children. I think the reason club penguin's design is so iconic is a result of it being a child friendly platform. Many assets, GUI interfaces, and elements kept children in mind. If Pocket Penguins is to stay as true to Club Penguin as possible, we must also be as friendly for children as possible. There will be a secition later on in this bible about childrens safety.
- The page content will go as follows
