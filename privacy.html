					<h2>Parent's Guide</h2>
					<p>
						Parents, we know it can be hard to monitor your childs every move on
						the internet. It's a wild place, and at Pocket Penguins we want to
						ensure a safe place for your children to chat with others and form
						lasting friendships. To ensure your child's safety, here are some
						guidlines and restrictions we have put into place on our site.
					</p>
					<p>
						If your child asks to sign up for a Pocket Penguins account, make
						sure they get permission from you, and that they use your email
						address. Help guide them through the sign up process, and make sure
						the account is labelled as a child account
					</p>
					<p>
						On our site, you should always label an account as a child account
						if the user is under 14 years of age.
					</p>
					<p>
						Child accounts will not be able to access most of the website. Only
						hand picked, safety approved chat servers will be available for
						children to use. Approved servers do not allow any form of profane
						langauge, or link posting. With the approved servers, your child can
						safely chat with others.
					</p>
					<p>
						Child accounts will only be able to send direct messages to other
						Child accounts
					</p>
					<p>We will never ask for any of your childs information.</p>
					<p>Parents, we thank you for choosing Pocket Penguins!</p>
