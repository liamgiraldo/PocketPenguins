                    <h2>Update status</h2>
                    <p>
                        As much as I think it would be cool to update the news every day, some days there just isn't that much to say.
                        I finished my first Javascript course, and now I'm going to start learning how games work with it.
                        Right now really is just a learning grind, and it might be awhile before the learning starts to show on the site.
                        I'll try to get stuff out soon! Wish me luck.

                    <h2>Learning Javascript</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm pretty satisfied with the state of the site.
                        Right now I'm taking an online Javascript course, and I'm hoping to make a small game to put on the site before I start the real deal.
                        It's going to be a lot of work, but I think it's going to be worth it. I want to make thin ice as the first game.
                        Keep checking the news page for more updates!

                        We're online! I've spent a little money to get pocketpenguins.net, and I'm really happy to have it!
                        Share the link, www.pocketpenguins.net, with your friends and show them the site! Looking forward to building
                        the app, and i'll get started soon! Again it's going to be alot of work, but I'm ready for it.

                    <h2>News page is live!</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to Pocket Penguins! I've been working really hard on the website, and it's coming along nicely!
                        My priority right now is just finishing the web pages. After that, I'll get to work on the app itself.
                        I know nothing about javascript, games, or networking, so this is going to be one heck of a ride.
                        I'm really excited to get to work, and I'm already pleased with what I've accomplished!
